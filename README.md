# This game is based on SDG goal 13.
The game highlights the concept showing the importance of ozone layer in
the atmosphere. Here our player will be given with a gun that can be used to destroy the
 chemicals emitting from the factory and given points. If he misses to clear the pollution
done by factories i.e the pollutants are able to interact with the ozone layer which
destroys it slowly. He will be able to survive till the ozone layer is more than zero.



**Target audience** - Small kids who are not aware of what’s happening around the world
with the pollutants which are emitted from the luxury of our life.
This will teach them about the importance of OZONE layer and what all are happening to
protect it at the end of the game there is a pop up showing that.

Existing solution are not targeting the small kids who tomorrow will be doing the same if
the behavioral change is not done. Just by giving money for degrading is not enough
there’s a lot more than that.



**RULES**
The game has industries that emit pollutant gases
Player will be provided a gun to shoot the gases which will have preloaded bullets made of something like chemical scrubbers
Whenever the bullet hits the gas, the player will earn 100 points for bursting the gas bubble.
As the point increases, the ozone layer will also decrease when ozone crosses the layer.
At the end of the game when ozone layer comes to 0, the player will get to know their score.
