# Project: Ozone

<br>

## Description

<br>

### Problem

Our team engages with **Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Change.**

Climate change has become one of the prime concerns for humanity in the past decade. Countless efforts are being made to come up with solutions to counter this problem for the social interest of all living creatures on Earth. One problem among others was ozone layer depletion due to the release of gases containing halogens like CFCs(chlorofluorocarbons).

Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, which is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders. UV rays also affect plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity.

One of the ways to deal with problems on a global scale is to spread public awareness. Public opinion is an essential tool in passing and enforcing policies in democratic countries. One thing that could be added is selective awareness. Small kids or youth could be made aware of the problem because this will instil a sense of responsibility among them from a young age.


<br>

### Solution

Now, the problem of ozone layer depletion has been solved in recent years by the replacements and sale of equipment using CFCs with HFCs but the prime problem of climate change still lingers. HFC is still a greenhouse gas. What needs to be done is spread our achievements amongst young kids.

It’s not a hidden fact that young kids love to play video games. But a video game's purpose is not limited to providing entertainment. It can be very well modified to educate children about various topics. We plan to create such a game that would simulate ozone layer depletion and rejuvenation.

Rules:  
* The game consists of our main character, the ozone layer and 2 factories.
* The factories release gas orbs that harm the Ozone layer.
* Our main character is equipped with a magical gun that shoots chemical scrubbers that destroy the gas orbs.
* For each orb destroyed, the player will receive 100 points.
* Ozone layer has 100 health points initially.
* One gas orb can reduce it by 10. The background will also change.
* The game will end when the Ozone layer's health points drop to 0.

The genre for our game is **endless** and **rage**. Endless fits the game really well as it truly depicts how difficult and time-consuming tasks get on a global level, a real eternal ordeal. The game has a high initial difficulty, i.e, it is difficult to learn its controls when anyone playing is it for the first time but it’s a fast learner. The rage aspect of the game keeps the user engaged to try again and again to beat their previous high score.

There is also a secret ending to the game where if a certain threshold of points is crossed, the player is granted a huge power-up which can end the game immediately in the favour of the player. Thereby, the player receives a good end.

## Existing solutions

<br>

Many awareness-raising programs exist and many video games on it also exist. One of the most prominent video game being UN’s Reset Earth mobile game. But educative games aren’t supposed to be competitive. Its purpose is to educate its user, not to compete for a greater user base. Hence, its novelty lies in the idea of its simplicity.
	
The very idea of simplicity in the game where the importance of the ozone layer is presented helps not only the literate but also the illiterate to get the very concept and contribute in the behaviour change also.

## Technologies Used

<br>

Languages: HTML5, CSS and Javascript
FrameWork: [PhaserJs](http://phaser.io/) [PhaserJS API](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html)
Version Control: [Github](https://github.com/)
Hosting service: [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

<br>

## How to use? (For Developers)

<br>

These are some details that will help you understand the control flow in the project.

### Prerequisites

* Simply cloning the repository from Github is enough to develop the project.
* The repository consists of `phaser.min.js` which is an essential file that provides the Phaser framework.
* You should have a live server to locally host the game for development. It could either be a live server extensioin from your IDE or use a node package called [parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel).

<br>

### Website Navigation

* The website is a single page application where the user is first greeted by it's home page.
* Home page consist of 2 sections: `start game` and `rules`.
* The user can click on next button in rules to go through all the rules.
* The user needs to enter a username in order to play the game.
* The user can then play the game by clicking on `Start` button.
* The game starts and continues until the termination condition met.
* Then game over screen is shown with name and score on display.

<br>

## Future Prospects

<br>

* We can increase the progressive difficulty in the game
* Other polluting agents can be taken into consideration like methane, CFCs, etc, which will educate our audience about the agents destroying our Ozone and environment. 
* These new pollutants will have different speeds, hit points or effects.
* Perhaps a sequel could also be made targeted towards global warming where the player would get weaker if he decides to sit idle.
